# Act 1, Scene 1 The Witches

In this short scene, three characters identified in the script as "witches" meet near a battlefield and discuss their plans for the future. Then they vanish.

    FIRST WITCH
    When shall we three meet again
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

    SECOND WITCH
    When the hurlyburly's[1] done, | [1] confusion
    When the battle's lost and won.

    THIRD WITCH
    That will be ere[1] the set of sun. | [1] before

    FIRST WITCH
    Where the place?

    SECOND WITCH
                    Upon the heath.

    THIRD WITCH
    There to meet with Macbeth.

    FIRST WITCH
    I come, Graymalkin![1] 
    | [1] witches familiar, a cat 

    SECOND WITCH
                    Paddock[1] calls. 
                    | [1] witches familiar, a frog

    THIRD WITCH
                                Anon[1]. 
                                | [1] soon, 
                                maybe "we'll talk soon,"
                                or "right away," perhaps
                                spoken to her familiar,
                                meaning, "I'll come right
                                away." 

    ALL
    Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
    Hover through the fog and filthy air.

    *Exeunt*

The witches are temptresses. They temp directors into their worst habit, which is to come up with "cool," "original," "dramatic" ideas which aren't based in the text. 

"How are my witches going to be different from the witches in all those other productions? What will show off my creativity? How can I avoid Halloween cliches?" 

But before we get to any of that, let's take a deep breath, and ask the two basic questions we always need to ask:

1. What are the events?
1. What are the motivations?

By "events," I mean the turning points of the scene. When does something change from A to B? If there's no change, there's no scene. And if that exact point of change, the hinge, is glossed over or muddied, the scene won't be exciting.

Motivations are what tie the characters to the event. What do they want? How do they attempt to get what they want, and what are the stakes involved? If they're not high, there's no scene. Neither the actors nor the audience will be invested. 

How do these motivations *cause* the events to happen?

Even in this simple scene there's an event. It's easy to spot because the scene starts with a question:

    FIRST WITCH
    When shall we three meet again
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

And there's another question shortly after:

    FIRST WITCH
    Where the place?

The events are when these question get answered. State A, the before, is when the questions haven't been answered yet. Then there are the events, the answers, and then there's state B, after the events, when there are no more questions and the witchs can leave. 

I've seen many productions of the play where there are no questions and no answers. They whole scene is played in an ritualistic chant. There's no sense that the First Witch is actually seeking information that she doesn't have. I prefer to take it at face value. She's genuinely asking because she genuinely wants an answer.

But why? If she's just idly curious, there's no scene. She must *need* to know. There must be some reason why getting this information is vitally important. There must be stakes. Then both actors and audience will have something to latch onto: a high stakes question and an event when it gets answered. 

The audience doesn't need to know *why* these questions are so importanrt to the witches; they just need to know they *are* important. They need to feel that the witches have some sense or urgency, some need to get things resolved so that they can move on. So the goal here isn't to somehow pass a message of "what's actually going on" from director to audience.

When directors analyze texts, they mix what's actually there, in the words, with their own fancies, which the use to fill in the blanks. The ratio of that mix differs from director to director. I tend towards something like 80% text, 80% me, and the "me" 20% part can be as fanciful as I want, as long as it doesn't contradict the text--at least not too much. 

It's somewhere in the tension between fidelity and rebellion that the art of directing lies. The director must be in love with the script, or what's the point? Why direct it? But he must also challenge it and be challenged by it. There must be push and pull, as when a jazz musician improvises a standard. If he veers to far, it's unrecognizable; if he sticks to the score, note for note, it's not jazz. 

We won't find an explicit reason for the First Witch's queries in the text, but let's dig a little futher and see if there's anything we can build on.

The next time we meet the witches (on the heath, waiting for Macbeth), they have this conversation:

    FIRST WITCH
    Where hast thou been, sister?

    SECOND WITCH
    Killing swine.

    THIRD WITCH
    Sister, where thou?

    FIRST WITCH
    A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
    And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
    'Give me,' quoth I:
    'Aroint[1] thee, witch!' the rump-fed[2] ronyon[3] cries.

        [1] Go way, [2] spoiled or fat, [3] rude term
        for a women, like "bitch"

    Her husband's to Aleppo[1] gone, master o' the Tiger[2]:

        | [1] A city in Syria, [2] a ship

    But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
    And, like a rat without a tail,
    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

        | NOTE: witches could turn into tail-less rats;
        "I'll do" could be any form of mischief, but
        it could also refer to sex. The First Witch
        could be saying she's going to seduce the
        chestnut-eating woman's husband. 

        Below, she says "I will drain him dry as hay."

    SECOND WITCH
    I'll give thee a wind.

    FIRST WITCH
    Thou'rt kind.

    THIRD WITCH
    And I another.

    FIRST WITCH
    I myself have all the other,
    And the very ports they blow,
    All the quarters [1] that they know | [1] directions
    I' the shipman's card [1]. | [1] map
    I will drain him dry as hay:
    Sleep shall neither night nor day
    Hang upon his pent-house lid[1]; | [1] eyelid
    He shall live a man forbid[1]: | [1] cursed
    Weary se'nnights nine times nine
    Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
    Though his bark[1] cannot be lost, | [1]
    Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
    Look what I have.

    SECOND WITCH
    Show me, show me.

    FIRST WITCH
    Here I have a pilot's thumb,
    Wreck'd as homeward he did come.

    THIRD WITCH
    A drum, a drum:
    Macbeth doth come.

Apparently, the witches' "job" is to create mischief and suffering and report back to each other about it, or brag about it. 

So let's assume this isn't just a pasttime. The witches have a *quota*. They must complete three evil tasks. And the three they have to offer their boss (Hecate, who appears later in the play), are killing swine (rather weak, but hopefull acceptable), seducing sailors, and--getting a littl ahead of ourselves--tempting Macbeth to murder. 

Why three tasks? Well, there are three witches. Also, right before Macbeth enters into this second second scene, the witches chant

    ALL
    The weird sisters, hand in hand,
    Posters[1] of the sea and land, | [1] voyagers
    Thus do go about, about, about[1], | [1] round and round...
    Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,
    And thrice again, to make up nine,
    Peace, the charm's wound up[1]. | all set

Maybe each witch has some sort of talisman, some sort of object which she can use to show she's completed her task, maybe a stone.

When the Second Witch says "Killing swine," she can place her stone on the ground. When the First Witch brags about her "sailor's thumb," she can put *her* stone on the ground. And the Third Witch can deposit her stone when she says "A drum, a drum: / Macbeth doth come." 

Or maybe they use three voodoo dolls. 

Or three daggers. Daggers are key symbols in this play!

Whatever they use, we'll get the sense that they're marking off something, tallying their score in a diabolical video game. And when they chant "Thrice to thine..." they can circle their tally objects.

What if they don't meet their quota? What if the swine escape? What if the sailor keeps his thumb? What if Macbeth rejects his fate? 

Well then, the witches will be in trouble. Why? Because the stakes must be high. What kind of trouble? Let's make something up. Maybe the witches were once beautiful young women. Each time they failed to meet a deadline, they were aged. This has happened to them so many times, they're now crones. And if it happens again, they may die. 

So, going back to the first scene, *this* is why the First Witch's questions are so important--why she *must* get them answered. They have one day left to complete their mission--their three evil tasks--and, if they don't...


    FIRST WITCH
    When shall we three meet again
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

    SECOND WITCH
    When the hurlyburly's done,
    When the battle's lost and won.

    THIRD WITCH
    That will be ere the set of sun.

Maybe it's painful for the witches to be outside "ere the set of sun," and the Third Witch stares up into the sky, covers her eyes, and says this line with some anguish. But she knows they must risk it. What other chance do they have?

But why all the Q&A to begin with? Why does the First Witch seem to be ignorant while the others have some information? Maybe they can't just choose any evil deeds. Maybe they must pull their information from the spirit realm. Or they must peer into the future and see where it's best to insert themseles. To learn what they want to know, they must use magic.

What can we build from the fact that the First Witch is the one who asks questions. Let's see what happens mess with the punctuation just a little bit (Shakespeare won't mind, will he?), turning all of the Second Witch's statements into questions. 

I'd like to see what happens if Witches 1 and 2 are relying on Witch 3 for the answers. They pummel her with desperate questions. She's the only one with powers of divination. I'm also going to re-assign some of the lines, so that the Third Witch only speaks once.

    FIRST WITCH
    When shall we three meet again
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

    SECOND WITCH
    When the hurlyburly's done?
    When the battle's lost and won?

    FIRST WITCH
    That will be ere the set of sun.

    SECOND WITCH
    Where the place?

    FIRST WITCH
                    Upon the heath?

    THIRD WITCH
    There to meet with Macbeth.

I like this, because it suggests a specific relationship between the witches, with differences between them. The first two are servants of the third. Or the third is a slave of the first two, and she has to do their bidding. And she herself doesn't immediately know the answers. She has to work hard to pull them from her magical sources. Or she knows them, doesn't want to give them up, and the other two have to torture her to get her to speak. Or they have to feed her treats. There's lots of fodder here for rehearsal. 

Maybe she can't walk. Maybe she's blind and the other two always have to prop her up or carry her. But she's the special one. 

In any case, we now have the makings of a scene. We have some stakes, some motivations, and an event! We have a beginning and an end. We have a transition.

Keep in mind that it's okay for the audience not to know all of this. They don't know--and can't really know--that the witches are on a tight deadline, though maybe they'll get an inkling of this from their urgency. The goal is to give actors and audience a visceral sense of something important happening. Something that matters.
